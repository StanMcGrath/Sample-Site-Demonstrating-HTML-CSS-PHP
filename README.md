# Sample-Site-Demonstrating-HTML-CSS-PHP

This site was built as part of a project to create sample functionality of an e-commerce website. 

We demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS to manually code the website from scratch, bootstrap to make the site responsive, SQL to create and populate a database for the site, and PHP to link the site and database together for database queries and manipulation.

The site is not currently being hosted, but the HTML, CSS, bootstrap and PHP code may be perused within the PHP files in this repository. 

The .sql file contains the script to create and populate the database.
